@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note=" Strong interactions can lead to the transmission behavior that is not captured by the one-body Schr{\"o}dinger equation, e.g., to a collective resonant transport~\cite {Schlagheck2005}."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note2,key="Note2",note="In general, one needs to include the momentum distribution of the reservoir, $n(k)$, in the cost function. To this end, one might multiply in Eq.~(\ref {eq:cost1}) $T_{\protect \bm  {\theta }}(k)$ by $n(k)$; the rest of the discussion is untouched. The function $n(k)$ can be determined by the Bose-Einstein or Fermi-Dirac distributions. The illustration in the text practically corresponds to a Fermi gas at zero temperature, i.e., $n(k<k_F)=1$ and zero otherwise, with the Fermi energy that satisfies $1\ll k_F^2 \ll A_\protect \mathrm  {min}$"}
