@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note=" Strong interactions can lead to the transmission behavior that is not captured by the one-body Schr{\"o}dinger equation, e.g., to a collective resonant transport~\cite {Schlagheck2005}."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note2,key="Note2",note="See the Supplementary Material for the full form of $J_{\protect \bm  {\theta }}^{\protect \mathrm  {aug}}$ and for the solution to the non-linear Schr{\"o}dinger equation for the impurity-(Bose gas) problem."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note3,key="Note3",note="In general, one needs to include the distribution of particles over the energy in the reservoir, $n(k)$, in the cost function. To this end, one might simply multiply in Eq.~(\ref {eq:cost1}) $T_{\protect \bm  {\theta }}(k)$ by $n(k)$, leaving the rest as is. The function $n(k)$ is determined by the Bose-Einstein or Fermi-Dirac distributions, temperature and the shape of the trap. Current Eq.~(\ref {eq:cost1}) assumes a Fermi gas at zero temperature in a harmonic trap, i.e., $n(k<k_F)=1$ and zero otherwise."}
