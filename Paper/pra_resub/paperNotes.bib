@FOOTNOTE{Note2,key="Note2",note="See the Supplementary Material for the full form of $J_{\protect \bm  {\theta }}^{\protect \mathrm  {aug}}$ and for the solution to the non-linear Schr{\"o}dinger equation for the impurity-(Bose gas) problem. The Supplementary Material includes Refs.~\cite {tsuzuki1971,ishikawa1980}"}
@FOOTNOTE{Note3,key="Note3",note="For a reservoir at a finite temperature it is beneficial to include the energy distribution, $n(k)$, in the cost function. To this end, one should simply convolute $T_{\protect \bm  {\theta }}(k)$ in Eq.~(\ref {eq:cost1}) with $n(k)$. The function $n(k)$ is determined by the Bose-Einstein or Fermi-Dirac distributions, temperature and the shape of the trap. For simplicity, we assume in current Eq.~(\ref {eq:cost1}) a one-dimensional Fermi gas at zero temperature in a harmonic trap, i.e., $n(k<k_F)=1$ and zero otherwise."}
